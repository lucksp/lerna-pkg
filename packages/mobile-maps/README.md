# @lucksp/mobile-maps

This is just wrapper around Expo's
[MapView](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/map-view/).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @lucksp/mobile-maps
```

## Usage

> You can also pass all the same `MapViewProps` from `react-native-maps` library

Note the expected shape of all the marker points. We use attributes
`isAvailable`, and `is-electric-vehicle` to color the icons based on Mobile
Design System.
